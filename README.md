Shopping Cart Exercise
This exercise demonstrates the implementation of a shopping cart feature using React. It consists of two main components: ProductList and Cart.

ProductList Component
The ProductList component displays a list of products available for purchase. Each product is represented by a card containing its name, description, price, and an "Add to Cart" button. Users can click the button to add the product to their shopping cart.

Cart Component
The Cart component displays the user's shopping cart. It shows the total price of all items in the cart and the total number of items. Users can also clear the cart by clicking the "Clear Cart" button.

Technologies Used
React: Used for building the user interface and managing state.
Context API: Used for managing global state and sharing data between components.
JSON data: Product information is stored in a JSON file and fetched dynamically.
Concepts Demonstrated
Component composition: Breaking down the UI into smaller, reusable components.
State management: Managing the state of the shopping cart and product list using React's state and Context API.
Responsive design: Making the application responsive to different screen sizes using Bootstrap classes.
Event handling: Handling user interactions such as adding items to the cart and clearing the cart.
